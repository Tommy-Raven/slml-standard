NON-NORMATIVE — HUMAN-READABLE CLAIMS GUIDE
Example: example_slml_v01_hawkseye_minimal_manifest.json
Target standard: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)

What this example shows
1) How to make a minimal, machine-ingestible manifest that is eligible to be ADMISSIBLE.
2) How to separate “claims” (the manifest) from “proof” (evidence pointers), while keeping both reproducible.
3) How to satisfy hawkseye’s hard invariants with the smallest possible surface area.

Core claims this manifest makes (in structured form)
A. Role integrity and referential closure
- Each entity has exactly one canonical role.
- Entity IDs are unique.
- Every referenced entity in system declarations, obligations, and inconvenience burdens exists.

B. User–beneficiary alignment (mandatory in hawkseye)
- The declared User set equals the declared Beneficiary set.
- Therefore: the system claims it is designed such that the same entity is both consumer and beneficiary.

C. Ownership direction (mandatory in hawkseye)
- ownership_explicit = true
- control_direction = DESIGNER_TO_USER
This asserts the system claims a downstream control relationship toward the User.

D. Consent (mandatory in hawkseye)
- consent_explicit = true
- implied_consent_accepted = false
- renegotiation_on_change = true
- consent_expires_at is present and bounded
This asserts the system claims it does not treat use/dependency as consent, and that consent is time-bounded and renegotiable.

E. Inconvenience model (mandatory in hawkseye)
- Declares four dimensions: TIME, REMOVAL_DIFFICULTY, BEHAVIOR_CLARITY, PRIVACY_RISK
- Declares non-negative weights that normalize exactly to 1.0
- Provides expected burdens for each declared USER and each declared BENEFICIARY, using exactly the declared dimensions

F. Obligations (strict)
- Includes a single USER-directed obligation of type INFORMATIONAL_DISCLOSURE.
- It is revocable, requires no consent, and has an expiry.
- The obligation direction is PRODUCT → USER, which is the only allowed USER-facing direction in v0.1 validator logic.

How to reuse this pattern safely
- Replace entity IDs with your real system actors.
- Keep USER and BENEFICIARY declarations identical under hawkseye.
- Ensure weights sum to exactly 1.0.
- Ensure each burden row contains exactly: “entity” plus the full dimension set (no extras, no missing keys).
- Keep USER-directed obligations informational-only, revocable, consent_required=false, and expiring.
