NON-NORMATIVE — EVIDENCE POINTERS AND REGISTRY
Example: example_slml_v01_hawkseye_minimal_manifest.json
Target standard: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)

────────────────────────────────────────────
EVIDENCE SCOPE AND LIMITS (REQUIRED CONTEXT)
────────────────────────────────────────────

These evidence pointers explain how to demonstrate that the manifest’s claims are:

- evaluable by the canonical SLML validator
- reproducible against exact versioned artifacts
- auditable under SLML’s structural invariants

They do NOT, by themselves, prove the real-world behavioral truth of a system.

Instead, they prove that:
- claims are formally stated
- claims are falsifiable
- claims are auditable by SLML
- claims are backed by real-world data sources and well-known or documented facts
  that can be independently consulted

SLML evaluates the structure and legitimacy of claims, not their ultimate empirical
truth. Empirical truth is supported through referenced evidence, not asserted by
the validator.

────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT COUNTS AS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE (v0.1)
────────────────────────────────────────────

For SLML v0.1 (hawkseye), admissible evidence consists of:

1) Stable, versioned artifacts that allow independent reproduction of validation
2) Referential documentation that substantiates the plausibility of claims
3) Publicly accessible or verifiable sources that ground claims in known facts
4) Clear linkage between claims and evidence (no orphaned assertions)

Evidence may be documentary, technical, or referential.
Evidence does not need to be exhaustive; it must be traceable.

────────────────────────────────────────────
EVIDENCE POINTERS BY CLAIM GROUP
────────────────────────────────────────────

A) Reproducibility and Traceability

Evidence pointers:
- Canonical file path:
  example_slml_v01_hawkseye_minimal_manifest.json
- Declared standard:
  SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)
- Validator reference:
  SLML canonical validator v0.1 (hawkseye)
- Hash placeholders:
  - manifest sha256: sha256:TBD_MANIFEST_HASH
  - validator sha256: sha256:TBD_VALIDATOR_HASH

Rationale:
These artifacts allow any third party to independently reproduce the validation
result for this manifest against the same standard version.

────────────────────────────────────────────

B) Role Integrity and Referential Closure

Evidence pointers:
- entities[] section of the manifest
- validator role-integrity checks (unique IDs, canonical roles)
- absence of undeclared or dangling entity references

Rationale:
Role integrity and referential closure are proven mechanically by validation.
No external evidence is required beyond the manifest and validator output.

────────────────────────────────────────────

C) User–Beneficiary Alignment

Evidence pointers:
- system.declared_user_entities
- system.declared_beneficiary_entities

Rationale:
In hawkseye, user–beneficiary alignment is a structural claim.
Its admissibility is determined entirely by manifest structure.

────────────────────────────────────────────

D) Consent Invariants

Evidence pointers:
- consent.consent_explicit = true
- consent.implied_consent_accepted = false
- consent.renegotiation_on_change = true
- consent.consent_expires_at present and bounded

Supporting real-world documentation:
- Public consent policy documents
- Terms of service sections describing consent scope and expiration
- Change-notification or renegotiation procedures

Rationale:
SLML verifies that consent is *claimed* to be explicit, bounded, and renegotiable.
External documentation supports the plausibility and grounding of that claim.

────────────────────────────────────────────

E) Inconvenience Model Validity

Evidence pointers:
- inconvenience.model.dimensions
- inconvenience.weights (normalized to 1.0)
- inconvenience.expected entries with full dimension coverage

Supporting real-world documentation:
- User documentation describing time cost, removal procedures, behavior clarity,
  and privacy practices
- Published UX or privacy notices corresponding to declared dimensions

Rationale:
The validator checks internal consistency.
External documentation grounds the declared inconvenience levels in known facts.

────────────────────────────────────────────

F) Obligations Constraints

Evidence pointers:
- obligations[] entries
- obligation direction (PRODUCT → USER)
- obligation type = INFORMATIONAL_DISCLOSURE
- revocable = true
- consent_required = false
- expires_at present

Supporting real-world documentation:
- User-facing disclosure notices
- Update or change-log documentation
- Data-handling disclosures

Rationale:
The validator enforces obligation structure.
External documentation demonstrates that such disclosures exist and are not fictional.

────────────────────────────────────────────
EVIDENCE REGISTRY (REFERENTIAL, VERIFIABLE)
────────────────────────────────────────────

The following registry enumerates concrete evidence references supporting the
claims made in this example. These entries are illustrative and must be replaced
with real references in real manifests.

Registry format:
ID | Evidence Type | Description | Location / Reference | Verifiability

E-001
Type: Artifact
Description: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye) canonical specification

Verifiability: Hash-verifiable, repository-stable

E-002
Type: Artifact
Description: SLML v0.1 canonical validator
Location: tools/SLML_validator_v01.py (or release artifact)
Verifiability: Hash-verifiable, executable

E-003
Type: Documentation
Description: Public consent and disclosure policy
Location: https://example.org/consent-policy
Verifiability: Public, date-stamped

E-004
Type: Documentation
Description: User documentation describing removal and behavior
Location: https://example.org/user-docs/removal
Verifiability: Public, versioned

E-005
Type: Documentation
Description: Privacy practices corresponding to declared PRIVACY_RISK
Location: https://example.org/privacy
Verifiability: Public, auditable

────────────────────────────────────────────
BOUNDARY STATEMENT (IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────────────────

This evidence registry supports the claim that the manifest:

- is formally specified
- is evaluable by SLML
- is grounded in documented, real-world facts

It does not assert that the system’s behavior is correct, ethical, or complete.

Truth of behavior remains falsifiable outside SLML.
Legitimacy of claims remains decidable within SLML.

That boundary is intentional and invariant.
