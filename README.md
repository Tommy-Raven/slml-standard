# SLML Standard Monorepo

This repository is the canonical, versioned home of the **Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML)** and its companion semantic module **Truth Vector Semantics (TVS)**.

SLML is a **design-time admissibility gate**. It determines whether a system is structurally permitted to claim user-serving legitimacy, based on explicit ownership, explicit consent, obligation directionality, and inconvenience symmetry.

TVS is a **semantic truth-fracture classifier**. It classifies representations (claims, disclosures, outputs) into categories like ERROR, LIE, MISLEADING_TRUTH, FICTION, etc. TVS is **orthogonal** to SLML admissibility.

## Authority model (non-negotiable)

- **Normative authority lives only in `standards/<version>/`.**
- Validators, schemas, examples, and docs outside `standards/` are **non-authoritative**.
- Released standards are **immutable**: a frozen version directory MUST NOT be edited after release.
- Any change to the standard requires a **new version directory** (e.g., `v0.2/`) and a corresponding self-manifest.

## Repository structure

- `standards/`  
  Normative, versioned, immutable artifacts.

- `schemas/`  
  Machine-readable schema contracts per version.

- `validators/`  
  Reference and community validator implementations (non-authoritative).

- `manifests/`  
  Self-manifests and example manifests for testing and integration.

- `docs/`  
  Informative, non-normative guidance (never defines rules).

- `tools/`  
  Utilities (e.g., release hashing).

## Start here

1. `standards/v0.1/SLML_SPEC.txt` (normative)
2. `standards/v0.1/SLML_SELF_MANIFEST.toml` (self-governing proof)
3. `validators/reference/` (reference validator; non-authoritative)

## Versioning and immutability

- Each version directory under `standards/` is immutable after tagging (e.g., `slml-v0.1`).
- New semantics => new version directory.
- Backward compatibility is not assumed unless explicitly stated in the newer version’s normative text.

## Releases

Immutable releases are published as Git tags (and GitHub Releases) named:

- `slml-vX.Y` (e.g., `slml-v0.1`)

Each release should include:
- a cryptographic hash listing of `standards/vX.Y/` generated by `tools/hash_release.py`
- the frozen normative artifacts

## Non-claims

SLML:
- does not evaluate intent, legality, popularity, or aggregate utility
- does not assign blame
- does not provide graded scores

SLML only evaluates structural admissibility: **ADMISSIBLE** or **CORRUPTED**.
