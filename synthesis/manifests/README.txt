SYNTHESIS MANIFESTS
==================

STATUS
------

This directory is NON-NORMATIVE.

Contents of this directory do not define, modify, or interpret
the SLML standard.

Normative authority exists exclusively under:

  standard_released/Implementation/


PURPOSE
-------

This directory contains synthesis manifests representing real,
historical, or hypothetical systems.

These manifests are intended as structured inputs for:

- exploratory inspection
- cross-disciplinary comparison
- tooling experimentation
- structural analysis exercises

They exist to illustrate how diverse systems *may be represented*
when expressed in manifest form.


NATURE OF CONTENT
-----------------

Manifests in this directory are:

- descriptive, not prescriptive
- factual or fact-derived where possible
- incomplete or idealized where necessary
- intentionally non-adjudicative

They may reflect:
- publicly documented system structures
- inferred structural relationships
- simplified or abstracted representations

They do NOT assert correctness, completeness, or authority.


NON-JUDGMENT STATEMENT
---------------------

Manifests in this directory:

- do not claim legitimacy
- do not assert admissibility
- do not imply compliance
- do not encode approval or disapproval
- do not represent evaluation outcomes

No conclusions should be drawn from the presence of any manifest
in this directory.


RELATION TO SLML TOOLING
-----------------------

Manifests in this directory MAY be used as optional inputs to
SLML tooling for private or exploratory analysis.

However:

- this repository does not publish SLML evaluation results
- no outputs, scores, or determinations are stored here
- no manifest is presented as having passed or failed any audit

Interpretation of any tooling output remains the responsibility
of the user.


SCOPE LIMITATION
----------------

This directory does not:

- define requirements
- establish baselines
- provide reference implementations
- recommend structural patterns
- set expectations for real systems

It exists solely to support understanding and experimentation.


INTERPRETATION NOTICE
---------------------

In the event of ambiguity or dispute, the authoritative
specification under:

  standard_released/Implementation/

controls exclusively.

Nothing in this directory supersedes or modifies released
normative artifacts.
