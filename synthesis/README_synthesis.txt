SYNTHESIS
=========

STATUS
------

This directory is NON-NORMATIVE.

Contents of this directory do not define, modify, interpret, or
extend the SLML standard.

Normative authority exists exclusively under:

  standard_released/Implementation/


PURPOSE
-------

The synthesis directory exists to host non-authoritative,
exploratory artifacts intended to support structural reasoning,
comparison, and understanding across diverse systems.

Materials under synthesis are provided to enable:

- cross-disciplinary inspection
- comparative structural modeling
- exploratory tooling input
- contextual illustration of system structures

Synthesis is informational, not adjudicative.


SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES
-------------------

Artifacts in this directory may:

- represent real, historical, or hypothetical systems
- be factual, fact-derived, or idealized
- simplify or abstract complex structures
- serve as inputs for private or experimental analysis

Artifacts in this directory MUST NOT:

- assert legitimacy or illegitimacy
- claim admissibility or corruption
- encode approval, endorsement, or validation
- define requirements or expectations
- function as compliance references
- be treated as evaluation results


RELATION TO SLML
----------------

SLML evaluates structural admissibility at design time.

Synthesis artifacts may be examined *using* SLML tooling, but
they do not represent SLML judgments, outcomes, or conclusions.

This repository deliberately does not publish or store the
results of SLML evaluations applied to synthesis artifacts.


SUBDIRECTORIES
--------------

manifests/
  Descriptive, non-judgmental system representations intended
  as structured inputs for exploratory inspection and tooling.

structural_ideals/
  Idealized or complete reference structures used for comparison,
  modeling, or thought experiments. These are not targets,
  recommendations, or standards.


NON-AUTHORIZATION STATEMENT
--------------------------

Nothing under synthesis:

- authorizes
- licenses
- permits
- sanctions
- endorses
- approves
- validates
- certifies
- recommends
- evaluates
- audits
- governs
- enforces

Presence within this directory implies no status, judgment, or
standing of any kind.


INTERPRETATION NOTICE
---------------------

In the event of ambiguity, dispute, or interpretive conflict,
the normative specification under:

  standard_released/Implementation/

controls exclusively.

No synthesis artifact supersedes, supplements, or modifies
released standard artifacts.
