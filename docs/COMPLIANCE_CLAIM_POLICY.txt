COMPLIANCE CLAIM POLICY
Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML)

Version: 0.1
Status: Informative Policy (Non-Normative)

---

1. PURPOSE

This document defines the conditions under which statements claiming
compliance with the Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML) are
factually accurate.

This policy does not grant rights, impose licensing terms, or constitute
certification. It exists to prevent ambiguity and misleading attribution
regarding SLML usage.

---

2. SCOPE

This policy applies to any public or private statement that includes,
but is not limited to, the phrases:

- “SLML-compliant”
- “Compliant with SLML”
- “Validated against SLML”
- “Conforms to SLML”
- “SLML-certified”
- “SLML-based certification”

The policy applies regardless of whether such statements appear in:

- documentation
- marketing materials
- technical reports
- audit summaries
- user interfaces
- contracts or proposals

---

3. DEFINITIONS

SLML Version  
A specific, immutable release of the SLML standard identified by a
version identifier (e.g., v0.1) and corresponding cryptographic hash.

SLML Manifest  
A complete, machine-readable Structural Legitimacy Manifest conforming
to a specific SLML version.

Validation  
Deterministic evaluation of an SLML manifest against the rules of the
referenced SLML version using a compatible validator.

---

4. ACCURATE COMPLIANCE CLAIMS

A compliance claim referencing SLML is accurate only if ALL of the
following conditions are met:

1. Version Specificity  
   The claim explicitly identifies the SLML version used
   (e.g., “SLML v0.1”).

2. Manifest Availability  
   A complete SLML manifest exists for the system or artifact.

3. Reproducible Validation  
   The manifest can be validated using a compatible validator, producing
   a binary result consistent with the claim.

4. Traceability  
   The claim references, directly or indirectly, a cryptographic hash or
   immutable identifier of the SLML version used for validation.

If any of these conditions is unmet, the claim is incomplete or
misleading.

---

5. INACCURATE OR MISLEADING CLAIMS

The following practices are considered inaccurate representations of
SLML usage:

- Claiming SLML compliance without identifying a specific version.
- Claiming SLML compliance without a corresponding manifest.
- Claiming SLML compliance based on partial, informal, or inferred
  evaluation.
- Claiming certification, endorsement, or approval by SLML, its author,
  or contributors.
- Using the SLML name or terminology to imply legitimacy without
  auditable evidence.

These determinations concern factual accuracy only and do not imply
malice, intent, or legal liability.

---

6. NO CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY

SLML is a standard, not a certifying body.

Neither the author nor contributors:
- issue certifications,
- approve implementations,
- or authorize third-party endorsement claims.

Any certification programs referencing SLML are independent and must
define their own criteria and accountability.

---

7. RELATION TO LICENSING

This policy is independent of licensing terms.

- Reuse of SLML text is governed by CC-BY 4.0.
- Use of schemas, validators, and tooling is governed by Apache 2.0.

Licensing permits reuse.  
Compliance claims concern factual correctness.

---

8. NON-ENFORCEMENT STATEMENT

This policy does not establish enforcement mechanisms and does not
require adherence.

It exists to provide clarity and to prevent ambiguity regarding the
meaning of compliance claims involving SLML.

---

9. INTERPRETATION

If ambiguity exists regarding a compliance claim, the absence of
versioned, auditable evidence should be treated as absence of verified
compliance.

---

End of Policy.
