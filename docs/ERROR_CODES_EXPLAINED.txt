ERROR CODES EXPLAINED

This document explains error codes in plain language.
It is informative only.

The authoritative error registry is ERROR_CODES.toml.

------------------------------------------------------------

What an error code means

An error code indicates that a manifest violates a required invariant.

An error code does not imply bad intent.
It indicates that the manifest is structurally invalid or contradictory.

------------------------------------------------------------

How to respond to an error code

There are only two valid remediation actions:

1) Change the system so the manifest becomes true.
2) Change the manifest so it accurately reflects reality.

Changing text to “pass” while reality remains unchanged is misuse.

------------------------------------------------------------

Common examples

R000_PARSE_FAILURE:
The manifest is missing required structure or fields.

R001_USER_BENEFICIARY_MISMATCH:
Declared users and declared beneficiaries are not exactly equal.
In v0.1, this includes any case where a third party benefits.

R007_WEIGHTS_INVALID:
Inconvenience weights are invalid or do not normalize.

R014_USER_COERCIVE_OBLIGATION:
A user is being subjected to a coercive obligation, which is prohibited.
