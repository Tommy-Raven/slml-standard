EXECUTIVE COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML)

Audience: Executives, Procurement Officers, Risk & Compliance Leaders

---

WHAT SLML IS

SLML is a design-time structural admissibility standard.
It determines whether a system may legitimately claim to serve its users.

SLML evaluates:
- ownership direction
- consent validity
- obligation flow
- inconvenience distribution

SLML does not evaluate intent, quality, or legality.

---

WHAT SLML IS NOT

SLML is not:
- an ethics framework
- a certification program
- a scoring system
- a regulatory replacement

SLML produces binary outcomes only:
ADMISSIBLE or CORRUPTED.

---

WHY INSTITUTIONS USE SLML

Institutions adopt SLML to prevent systems from being approved,
procured, or deployed while structurally misrepresenting who they serve.

SLML detects failures that:
- pass legal review
- pass ethical review
- pass user-satisfaction metrics
- pass factual accuracy checks

---

HOW COMPLIANCE WORKS

A system is SLML-compliant if and only if:

1) It has a complete SLML manifest
2) The manifest references a specific SLML version
3) Validation produces an ADMISSIBLE result
4) The version is immutable and traceable

Compliance claims without these elements are not auditable.

---

WHAT SLML COMPLIANCE MEANS

SLML compliance means:

- Users are the beneficiaries
- Consent is explicit and renegotiable
- Obligations do not flow upstream
- Burdens are not asymmetrically offloaded

It does not imply quality, safety, or endorsement.

---

HOW SLML IS USED IN PRACTICE

Common institutional integration points:

- procurement gates
- pre-deployment reviews
- system architecture approvals
- AI governance checkpoints

SLML is applied before deployment, not after harm.

---

RISK REDUCTION VALUE

SLML reduces:
- reputational risk
- compliance ambiguity
- post-hoc remediation costs
- governance disputes over intent

By making structural corruption visible early.

---

SUMMARY

SLML is an admissibility filter.
It prevents systems from claiming legitimacy they cannot structurally
support.

It is intentionally narrow.
That is why it works.
