ATTRIBUTION AND USE

Attribution under CC-BY 4.0 permits reuse, redistribution, and adaptation
of the specification text, provided appropriate credit is given.

Attribution does NOT constitute:
- certification,
- endorsement,
- validation,
- or compliance approval.

Statements such as “SLML-compliant”, “SLML-certified”, or “validated

COMPLIANCE AND TRACEABILITY

A system or artifact may accurately claim SLML compliance only if it can
produce, upon request:

- a complete SLML manifest,
- a reproducible validation result,
- a cryptographic hash or traceable reference to the exact SLML version
  used for evaluation.

Use of the SLML text or tooling without these elements is permitted;
claiming compliance without them is not an accurate representation.

This repository does not provide certification services and does not
authorize third parties to issue compliance endorsements.

NO ENDORSEMENT

Use of the name “Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language”, “SLML”, or
associated terminology does not imply endorsement by the author or
contributors.
