WORKED EXAMPLE: LYRIC EVALUATION WORKFLOW UNDER SLML v0.1 (HAWKSEYE)

This document explains why a closed lyric evaluation workflow can qualify.
It is informative only.

The authoritative example definition is NORMATIVE_EXAMPLES.toml.

------------------------------------------------------------

Why it can qualify

A lyric evaluation workflow can qualify when:

- it treats the lyric text as a closed input for the session,
- it does not reuse or externalize the lyric text,
- it does not train or aggregate across sessions,
- it does not create third-party benefit from the lyric text,
(In v0.1, the workflow qualifies only if the user is the only beneficiary.
No third-party beneficiary is permitted.)
- and it is explicit about its obligations and constraints.

------------------------------------------------------------

What “closed” means here

Closed means the workflow is not allowed to:

- compare against external corpora,
- store lyrics for reuse,
- share lyrics externally,
- derive persistent benefit for parties not declared in the manifest.

------------------------------------------------------------

How admissibility is protected

Admissibility is protected by:

- explicit consent requirements,
- explicit ownership and control direction,
- explicit inconvenience declaration,
- and strict obligation restrictions.

If any of these change in reality, the manifest must change.
If the manifest does not change, compliance becomes false.
