NON-COMPLIANT PATTERNS

This document explains common non-compliant patterns in plain language.
It is informative only.

The authoritative pattern taxonomy is NON_COMPLIANT_PATTERNS.toml.

------------------------------------------------------------

1) Hidden beneficiary

This happens when someone benefits from the system but is not declared
in the manifest.

Common signals include:
- undeclared analytics
- model training value extraction
- third-party reporting or sharing

A compliance claim is not accurate if beneficiaries are omitted.

------------------------------------------------------------

2) Implied consent

This happens when the system assumes consent rather than obtaining it
explicitly.

Common signals include:
- opt-out only designs
- prechecked consent toggles
- “by using this you agree” consent models

SLML requires explicit consent.

------------------------------------------------------------

3) Unbounded consent

This happens when consent has no expiry or cannot be renegotiated
when the system changes.

Consent must be time-bounded and renegotiable on change.

------------------------------------------------------------

4) Burden mismatch

This happens when inconvenience dimensions, weights, or expected burdens
do not match exactly.

Common signals include:
- the dimension list differs from burden keys
- weights omit a declared dimension
- burdens omit declared entities

If inconvenience cannot be computed deterministically,
the manifest is not compliant.

------------------------------------------------------------

5) Coercive user obligation

This happens when a user is required to do something beyond what SLML permits.

User-directed obligations are tightly restricted.
If a user obligation is coercive, non-revocable, or requires consent,
the manifest must be treated as corrupted.
