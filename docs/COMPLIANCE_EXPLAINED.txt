COMPLIANCE EXPLAINED

This document explains what an SLML compliance claim means.
It is informative only.

Authoritative requirements live in SPEC.toml and ERROR_CODES.toml.
If there is any conflict, those TOML files are authoritative.

------------------------------------------------------------

What “compliance” means

An SLML compliance claim is a statement of fact.

It means:

- a complete SLML manifest exists,
- the manifest validates under the canonical validator,
- the manifest is bound to the exact standard version used,
- and the validation result is reproducible.

It does not mean:

- certification,
- endorsement,
- moral approval,
- or legal compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------

Why reproducibility matters

A claim that cannot be reproduced cannot be trusted.

If a compliance claim is made, the claimant should be able to provide:

- the manifest,
- the validator output,
- and the cryptographic references to the exact standard version.

------------------------------------------------------------

What happens if a system changes

If system behavior changes, the manifest may become false.
If the manifest becomes false, compliance ends.

Compliance is not permanent.
It is continuously falsifiable.

------------------------------------------------------------

How error codes work

If validation fails, the validator returns an error code.

Error codes are precise.
They indicate which invariant was violated.

Fixing wording without fixing reality is not remediation.

User and beneficiary alignment (v0.1)

In SLML v0.1, declared users and declared beneficiaries must match exactly.

A system cannot claim compliance if any third party benefits,
even if that party is disclosed, because v0.1 forbids extra beneficiaries.
