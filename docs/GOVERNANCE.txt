REPOSITORY GOVERNANCE

This document explains how governance works in the SLML standard repository.

It exists to make the rules clear to humans.
The authoritative governance rules are encoded in GOVERNANCE.toml.

If there is any conflict between this document and GOVERNANCE.toml,
the TOML file is authoritative.

------------------------------------------------------------

1) IMMUTABILITY RULE

Once a standard version is released and tagged, its contents are immutable.

The directory for a released version, such as:

  standards/v0.1/

must not be modified after release.

Any change to released artifacts, regardless of intent,
constitutes a new version and must occur in a new directory,
for example:

  standards/v0.2/

------------------------------------------------------------

2) AUTHORITY BOUNDARY

Normative authority lives only in:

  standards/<version>/

No maintainer, issue discussion, pull request conversation,
or external statement has interpretive authority over released artifacts.

Documentation outside the standards directory is informative only
and does not define rules.

------------------------------------------------------------

3) VERSION CREATION REQUIREMENTS

A new version directory must include, at minimum:

- an immutability notice
- a normative specification file
- a self-manifest that proves the version’s rules recursively
- any additional normative modules introduced by that version

A version is not eligible for release until its self-manifest
validates under its own rules.

------------------------------------------------------------

4) CONTRIBUTIONS POLICY

Allowed contributions include:

- adding new standard versions in new directories
- adding non-normative tooling
- adding non-normative documentation
- adding validator implementations that conform to an existing version

Not allowed:

- changing artifacts of a released version
- introducing clarifications that alter semantics without a new version
- adding defaults or inference behavior to reference validator outputs

------------------------------------------------------------

5) DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Disputes about meaning are resolved by:

1) the normative text in standards/<version>/
2) the validation behavior implied by that text

If ambiguity exists, the ambiguity is considered a defect.
It may only be corrected by issuing a new version.

------------------------------------------------------------

6) RELEASE PROCESS (RECOMMENDED MINIMUM)

For a release vX.Y:

1. Ensure standards/vX.Y/ is complete.
2. Generate cryptographic hashes using:
   python tools/hash_release.py standards/vX.Y > standards/vX.Y/HASHES.sha256
3. Commit the hash file.
4. Create a git tag:
   git tag -a slml-vX.Y -m "SLML vX.Y immutable release"
5. Push the tag and create a GitHub Release with the frozen artifacts.

------------------------------------------------------------

7) MAINTAINER CONSTRAINT

Maintainers may manage repository operations,
but they do not possess authority to modify released semantics.

Authority resides in immutable artifacts
and in versioned evolution only.
