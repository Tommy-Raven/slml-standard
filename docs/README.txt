SLML Standard Monorepo

This repository is the canonical, versioned home of the
Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML)
and its companion semantic module
Truth Vector Semantics (TVS).

SLML is a design-time admissibility gate.
It determines whether a system is structurally permitted
to claim user-serving legitimacy, based on:

- explicit ownership
- explicit consent
- obligation directionality
- inconvenience symmetry

Truth Vector Semantics (TVS) is a semantic truth-fracture classifier.
It classifies representations (claims, disclosures, outputs)
into categories such as:

- ERROR
- LIE
- MISLEADING_TRUTH
- FICTION

TVS is orthogonal to SLML admissibility.
A system may be SLML-admissible and still produce misleading or false claims,
which TVS evaluates independently.

AUTHORITY MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Normative authority lives only in:
  standards/<version>/

- Validators, schemas, examples, and documentation outside
  standards/ are non-authoritative.

- Released standards are immutable.
  A frozen version directory MUST NOT be edited after release.

- Any change to the standard requires a new version directory
  (for example: v0.2/)
  and a corresponding self-manifest.

------------------------------------------------------------

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

standards/
  Normative, versioned, immutable artifacts.

schemas/
  Machine-readable schema contracts per version.

validators/
  Reference and community validator implementations
  (non-authoritative).

manifests/
  Self-manifests and example manifests for testing
  and integration.

docs/
  Informative, non-normative guidance.
  Documentation here never defines rules.

tools/
  Utilities, including release hashing.

------------------------------------------------------------

START HERE

1. standards/v0.1/SLML_SPEC.txt
   (normative)

2. standards/v0.1/SLML_SELF_MANIFEST.toml
   (self-governing proof)

3. validators/reference/
   (reference validator; non-authoritative)

------------------------------------------------------------

VERSIONING AND IMMUTABILITY

- Each version directory under standards/ is immutable
  after tagging (for example: slml-v0.1).

- New semantics require a new version directory.

- Backward compatibility is not assumed unless explicitly
  stated in the newer version’s normative text.

------------------------------------------------------------

RELEASES

Immutable releases are published as Git tags
(and GitHub Releases) named:

  slml-vX.Y
  (for example: slml-v0.1)

Each release should include:

- a cryptographic hash listing of standards/vX.Y/
  generated by tools/hash_release.py

- the frozen normative artifacts

------------------------------------------------------------

NON-CLAIMS

SLML:

- does not evaluate intent
- does not evaluate legality
- does not evaluate popularity
- does not evaluate aggregate utility
- does not assign blame
- does not provide graded scores

SLML evaluates only structural admissibility.

The result is always exactly one of:

ADMISSIBLE
or
CORRUPTED
