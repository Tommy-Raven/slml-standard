OVERVIEW

This document explains SLML in plain language.
It is informative only.

Authoritative rules live in SPEC.toml and related authoritative TOML files.
If there is any conflict, the TOML files are authoritative.

------------------------------------------------------------

What SLML is

SLML is a manifest standard used to make system legitimacy claims
mechanically checkable.

A manifest is a structured claim about a system, including:

- who the system is for (users),
- who benefits (beneficiaries),
- who owns control direction,
- what consent rules apply,
- what burdens the system imposes,
- and what obligations are enforced.

SLML does not attempt to read intent.
SLML evaluates structure and declared invariants only.

------------------------------------------------------------

What SLML produces

Validation yields exactly one outcome:

- ADMISSIBLE
- CORRUPTED

There is no partial compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------

How SLML relates to TVS

Truth Vector Semantics (TVS) classifies the truth quality of statements.

SLML and TVS are orthogonal:
- SLML evaluates whether a system is structurally permitted to claim legitimacy.
- TVS evaluates whether representations are truthful, misleading, fictional, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------

How a real engineer uses SLML

A system engineer prepares:

1) a machine-ingestible manifest (JSON)
2) supporting evidence inputs (typically TXT)
3) traceability bindings (hashes and references)

Then the validator checks the manifest against the standard.

A compliance claim is only accurate if traceability is reproducible.

User and beneficiary rule (v0.1)

In SLML v0.1, the declared beneficiaries MUST equal the declared users.

This is an exact set equality rule.
No additional beneficiaries are permitted in v0.1.

If any non-user entity benefits in reality, the manifest must be treated as
corrupted under v0.1.
