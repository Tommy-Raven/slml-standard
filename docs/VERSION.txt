Structural Legitimacy Manifest Language (SLML)

Standard Version: 0.1
Release Status: Released (Immutable)

This version represents the initial standardized release of SLML.

SLML v0.1 defines:
- the core manifest structure,
- mandatory legitimacy invariants,
- admissibility outcomes (ADMISSIBLE or CORRUPTED),
- and the canonical validation model.

Once released, this version is immutable.
No changes may be made to the v0.1 standard text or semantics.

Any modification, extension, or correction requires:
- a new version directory (for example: v0.2),
- a new version identifier,
- and an updated self-manifest.

This file is informational only.
The authoritative version identifier is defined in VERSION.toml.
