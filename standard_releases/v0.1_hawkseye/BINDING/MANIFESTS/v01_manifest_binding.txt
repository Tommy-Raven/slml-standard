v01_manifest_binding.txt

STATUS: NORMATIVE
APPLIES TO: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)

PURPOSE

This document binds a concrete SLML manifest to its associated claim set, evidence registry, and specification version.

This binding establishes traceability. It does not assert correctness, approval, or real-world behavior.

A manifest without an accompanying binding is unbound and non-auditable under SLML.


---

BOUND MANIFEST

manifest_id: v01_binded_manifest.json
manifest_location: BINDING/MANIFEST/
spec_name: SLML
spec_version: 0.1
spec_codename: hawkseye

The bound manifest is the sole subject of evaluation. All claims, evidence, and validation outcomes refer exclusively to this file.


---

BOUND CLAIM SET

claims_id: v01_binded_claims.txt
claims_location: BINDING/CLAIMS/

The claim set enumerates all explicit assertions made by the manifest. No implicit claims are permitted. Any system property not declared as a claim is outside evaluation scope.


---

BOUND EVIDENCE REGISTRY

evidence_id: v01_docs_json.RAW
evidence_location: BINDING/EVIDENCE/

The evidence registry defines admissible evidence classes and provides verifiable references supporting the evaluability and auditability of the bound claims.

Evidence demonstrates that claims are:

concretely stated

externally referential

reproducible for evaluation


Evidence does not prove system behavior. Evidence proves that claims are grounded in documented, inspectable facts.


---

VALIDATION CONTEXT

validator_authority: standard_releases/v0.1_hawkseye/
validator_scope: manifest_only
evaluation_mode: deterministic
failure_mode: fail_fast

Validation results apply only to the bound manifest and its declared claims.


---

IMMUTABILITY

All bound artifacts are version-frozen. Any change to the manifest, claims, or evidence requires a new binding document and a new version identifier.


---

NON-GOALS

This binding does not:

modify the manifest

interpret claims

infer missing information

guarantee validator outcomes

assert ethical, legal, or functional quality
