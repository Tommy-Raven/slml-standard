NON-NORMATIVE — BINDED CLAIMS REFERENCE
Applies to: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)
Purpose: Explicitly bind declared claims to their evaluable surfaces and
         supporting evidence classes, without extending or redefining
         normative terminology.

────────────────────────────────────────
SCOPE AND FUNCTION
────────────────────────────────────────

This document enumerates the claims expressed in a manifest and binds each
claim to:

- the manifest fields that encode it
- the evaluation mechanism that assesses it
- the class of evidence suitable for supporting it

This file:
- does not assert correctness
- does not substitute for validation
- does not alter SLML semantics
- does not introduce new definitions

It exists to make claims auditable, traceable, and reviewable by humans.

────────────────────────────────────────
CLAIM BINDING MODEL
────────────────────────────────────────

Each claim is described using the following structure:

Claim ID
Claim Description (plain-language paraphrase)
Manifest Binding (exact fields)
Evaluation Surface (what checks it)
Evidence Class (what can support it)

────────────────────────────────────────
BINDED CLAIMS
────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-001
Description:
The manifest declares all system actors explicitly and assigns exactly one
canonical role per entity.

Manifest Binding:
- entities[].id
- entities[].role

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: role integrity and uniqueness checks

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text itself
- Validator output confirming role integrity

────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-002
Description:
The manifest declares the same entity set as both the system’s users and
beneficiaries.

Manifest Binding:
- system.declared_user_entities
- system.declared_beneficiary_entities

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: user–beneficiary alignment check

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text
- Validator output confirming alignment

────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-003
Description:
The manifest asserts explicit ownership declaration and a downstream control
direction toward the user.

Manifest Binding:
- ownership.ownership_explicit
- ownership.control_direction

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: ownership invariant checks

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text
- Referenced contractual or policy documentation (supporting plausibility)

────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-004
Description:
The manifest asserts that consent is explicit, bounded, renegotiable, and not
implied by use or dependency.

Manifest Binding:
- consent.consent_explicit
- consent.implied_consent_accepted
- consent.renegotiation_on_change
- consent.consent_expires_at

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: consent invariant checks

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text
- Public consent, terms, or policy documentation

────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-005
Description:
The manifest declares a complete inconvenience model with explicit dimensions,
normalized weights, and expected burdens for each declared user entity.

Manifest Binding:
- inconvenience.model.dimensions
- inconvenience.weights
- inconvenience.expected[]

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: inconvenience structure, normalization, and coverage checks

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text
- User documentation or disclosures corresponding to declared dimensions

────────────────────────────────────────

CLAIM-006
Description:
The manifest asserts that any user-facing obligation is informational in nature,
revocable, non-coercive, and time-bounded.

Manifest Binding:
- obligations[].from
- obligations[].to
- obligations[].type
- obligations[].revocable
- obligations[].consent_required
- obligations[].expires_at

Evaluation Surface:
- SLML validator: obligation direction and constraint checks

Evidence Class:
- Manifest text
- Disclosure notices, changelogs, or user-facing informational materials

IMPORTANT BOUNDARY
────────────────────────────────────────

These binded claims describe what is formally claimed and how those claims are
evaluated under SLML v0.1.

They do not prove real-world system behavior.
They do not assert ethical quality.
They do not substitute for empirical verification.

They exist to ensure that claims are:
- explicit
- falsifiable
- auditable
- referentially grounded

That boundary is intentional and invariant.
