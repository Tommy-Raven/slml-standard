STATUS: NORMATIVE
APPLIES TO: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)

PURPOSE

This document binds each declared claim to:

the manifest fields that encode the claim

the evaluation surface that assesses the claim

the evidence class(es) that may support the claim


This binding establishes traceability of claims. It does not assert correctness, approval, or real-world behavior.

A claim not listed here is unbound and outside the claim surface for this binding set.

BINDING BOUNDARY

This file binds claims to evaluation surfaces and evidence classes. It does not add claims not present in the bound manifest. It does not alter validator outcomes. Validation remains solely determined by the validator defined in the corresponding standard release.
