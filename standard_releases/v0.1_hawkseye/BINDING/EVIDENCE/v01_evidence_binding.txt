v01_evidence_binding.txt

STATUS: NORMATIVE
APPLIES TO: SLML v0.1 (hawkseye)

PURPOSE

This document binds a concrete evidence registry to the normative evidence documentation rules defined in:

standard_releases/v0.1_hawkseye/BINDING/EVIDENCE/v01_docs_json.RAW

This binding establishes which evidence entries are in scope for a given manifest binding and confirms that they conform to the recognized documentation classes.

This document does not assert correctness of system behavior. It establishes evidence traceability only.
