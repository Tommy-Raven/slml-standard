SLML STANDARD REPOSITORY
=======================

This repository is the canonical, versioned home of the
Structural Legitimacy Markup Language (SLML) standard and its
associated release artifacts.

----------------------------------------------------------------
AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION
----------------------------------------------------------------

Normative authority exists exclusively under:

  standard_released/Implementation/

Only artifacts located in versioned directories within
standard_released/Implementation/ are authoritative.

Documentation and explanatory material is located under:

  standard_released/Documentation/

Documentation is non-normative and MUST NOT be used to determine
compliance, admissibility, legitimacy, or enforcement claims.

All content outside standard_released/ is non-normative and
exists solely for drafting, analysis, tooling, or explanation.

Validators, schemas, examples, tools, and drafts outside
standard_released/ are NOT authoritative.

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMMUTABILITY MODEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Released versions under standard_released/ are immutable.
- A frozen version directory MUST NOT be edited after release.
- Any change to normative semantics requires a new version
  directory and a new release binding.
- Authority does not migrate forward implicitly.
- Backward compatibility is not assumed unless explicitly stated
  in the newer version’s normative text.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NON-NORMATIVE OVERVIEW (INFORMATIONAL)
----------------------------------------------------------------

SLML is a design-time structural admissibility gate.

It determines whether a system is structurally permitted to
claim user-serving legitimacy based on explicit properties,
including but not limited to:

- explicit ownership
- explicit consent
- obligation directionality
- inconvenience symmetry

SLML does not evaluate intent, morality, popularity, or utility.
It evaluates only structural admissibility.

Truth Vector Semantics (TVS) is a semantic truth-fracture
classifier that categorizes representations (claims, disclosures,
outputs) into classes such as:

- ERROR
- LIE
- MISLEADING_TRUTH
- FICTION

TVS is orthogonal to SLML admissibility.

A system may be SLML-admissible and still produce misleading or
false claims; TVS evaluates such representations independently.

----------------------------------------------------------------
REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------------------------------

standard_released/
  Canonical, versioned, immutable release artifacts.

  Implementation/
    Normative specification, schemas, invariants, and bindings.
    This is the sole source of authoritative truth.

  Documentation/
    Versioned, non-normative explanatory mirrors corresponding
    one-to-one with released implementation artifacts.

schemas/
  Machine-readable schema drafts and contracts.
  Non-authoritative unless released.

validators/
  Reference and community validator implementations.
  Non-authoritative.

manifests/
  Example and test manifests for tooling and integration.
  Non-authoritative.

tools/
  Utilities, including release hashing and validation tooling.
  Non-authoritative.

----------------------------------------------------------------
REFERENCE ENTRY POINTS
----------------------------------------------------------------

- standard_released/Implementation/vX_Y/
  (normative; authoritative specification)

- standard_released/Documentation/vX_Y/
  (non-normative; explanatory mirror)

- validators/reference/
  (reference implementation; non-authoritative)

----------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Immutable releases are published as Git tags and GitHub Releases
named:

  slml-vX.Y

Each release includes:

- the frozen normative artifacts under
  standard_released/Implementation/vX_Y/
- a cryptographic hash binding generated by release tooling
- corresponding versioned documentation

----------------------------------------------------------------
NON-CLAIMS
----------------------------------------------------------------

SLML:

- does not evaluate intent
- does not evaluate legality
- does not evaluate popularity
- does not evaluate aggregate utility
- does not assign blame
- does not produce graded scores

SLML evaluates only structural admissibility.

The result of evaluation is always exactly one of:

  ADMISSIBLE
  or
  CORRUPTED

----------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL NON-AUTHORIZATION STATEMENT
----------------------------------------------------------------

SLML is a standardized, binary-output, recursive, and
deterministic manifest evaluation.

It DOES NOT:

- authorize
- license
- permit
- sanction
- empower
- entitle
- validate
- endorse
- approve
- ratify
- grant
- commission
- certify
- verify
- confirm
- attest
- authenticate
- substantiate
- corroborate
- vouch
- notarize
- accredit
- qualify
- benchmark
- standardize
- audit
- inspect
- evaluate
- vet
- charter
- incorporate
- register
- enroll
- admit
- recognize
- designate
- appoint
- consent
- assent
- concur
- affirm
- acknowledge
- accept
- regulate
- oversee
- supervise
- govern
- mandate
- enforce
- monitor

No output of SLML constitutes permission, approval, or authority
of any kind, whether legal, moral, institutional, procedural,
or social.

----------------------------------------------------------------
ADDITIONAL DIRECTORY ROLES AND 
CONSTRAINTS ON REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following directories exist to support development, analysis,
testing, and interpretation of the SLML standard. Their presence
does not imply authority unless explicitly stated.

APPENDIX/
  Supplemental material, historical notes, extended rationale,
  and non-normative reference artifacts.

  Content in APPENDIX/ may elaborate on decisions, provide
  background context, or preserve superseded material, but is
  never authoritative and MUST NOT be treated as specification.

CONTRIBUTORS/
  Contributor-scoped materials, including example implementations
  and experimental artifacts submitted by external or internal
  authors.

  Subdirectories under CONTRIBUTORS/ are attributional and
  informational only. Inclusion does not imply endorsement,
  validation, or adoption into the standard.

docs/
  Non-normative explanatory material maintained at the repository
  root for drafting convenience, editorial iteration, or working
  notes.

  This directory is explicitly non-authoritative. Only
  documentation released under standard_released/Documentation/
  is considered part of a frozen release.

manifests/
  Example, test, and reference manifests used for tooling,
  validation testing, and integration demonstrations.

  Manifests in this directory do not define compliance and MUST
  NOT be used as normative references unless explicitly released
  under standard_released/Implementation/.

schemas/
  Draft and reference schema representations intended for
  machine-readability, tooling development, and validator support.

  Schemas outside standard_released/ are provisional and
  non-authoritative, regardless of structural similarity.

tools/
  Utility scripts and supporting tooling, including hashing,
  release preparation, validation helpers, and internal checks.

  Tools do not define the standard and do not participate in
  authority determination.

validators/
  Reference and community validator implementations.

  Validators demonstrate interpretation of the standard but do
  not define it. Divergence between validators does not alter
  normative meaning.

standard_released/
  The sole location of released standard artifacts.

  All authoritative material is versioned, immutable, and
  cryptographically bound under this directory. No other location
  in the repository may claim or imply authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORY PRESENCE PRINCIPLE
----------------------------------------------------------------

Directories exist in this repository to support correctness,
clarity, and reproducibility.

Presence does not imply:
- authority
- endorsement
- adoption
- compliance
- approval
- stability

Authority is conferred only by placement within a released,
versioned directory under standard_released/Implementation/.
