INSTITUTIONAL BRIEF
STRUCTURAL LEGITIMACY MARKUP LANGUAGE (SLML)
===========================================

STATUS
------

This document is NON-NORMATIVE.

It does not define, modify, or extend the SLML standard.
Normative authority exists exclusively under:

  standard_released/Implementation/

This brief exists to provide institutional context, explanatory
framing, and interpretive clarity for readers evaluating the
purpose and limits of SLML.


PURPOSE
-------

The Structural Legitimacy Markup Language (SLML) is a standardized,
binary-output, deterministic evaluation framework intended to
assess whether a system is structurally admissible to claim
user-serving legitimacy.

SLML addresses a specific institutional gap:

Existing mechanisms such as ethics guidelines, audits, compliance
programs, and fact-checking systems primarily evaluate intent,
outcomes, or content after harm has occurred.

SLML evaluates structure at design time.


SCOPE OF EVALUATION
-------------------

SLML evaluates ONLY structural admissibility.

Specifically, it examines whether a system’s design satisfies
explicit, user-facing structural conditions, including but not
limited to:

- explicit ownership
- explicit consent
- obligation directionality
- inconvenience symmetry

SLML does NOT evaluate:

- moral intent
- legality
- popularity
- utility
- benefit aggregation
- outcome quality
- harm severity
- policy compliance

SLML produces no scores, rankings, or gradients.

The result of evaluation is always exactly one of:

  ADMISSIBLE
  or
  CORRUPTED


NON-AUTHORIZATION CLARIFICATION
-------------------------------

SLML is an evaluative framework only.

It does NOT:

- authorize or permit action
- license or certify systems
- validate or endorse claims
- approve, ratify, or sanction behavior
- confer legitimacy, legality, or compliance
- grant rights, privileges, or entitlements
- substitute for governance, law, or oversight

No SLML output constitutes permission, approval, or authority of
any kind.


RELATION TO TRUTH VECTOR SEMANTICS (TVS)
---------------------------------------

Truth Vector Semantics (TVS) is a companion semantic classification
framework.

TVS classifies representations (claims, disclosures, outputs)
into semantic categories such as:

- ERROR
- LIE
- MISLEADING_TRUTH
- FICTION

TVS is orthogonal to SLML.

A system may be structurally admissible under SLML and still
produce misleading or false representations.

SLML evaluates structure.
TVS evaluates semantic truth conditions.


INTENDED INSTITUTIONAL USE
--------------------------

SLML is intended to be used as:

- a pre-deployment design evaluation lens
- a structural admissibility gate
- a diagnostic tool for identifying legitimacy claims that
  cannot be structurally supported

SLML is NOT intended to:

- replace institutional judgment
- automate enforcement decisions
- adjudicate disputes
- determine compliance or liability
- serve as a regulatory proxy

Institutions remain responsible for interpretation, governance,
and decision-making.


LIMITATIONS
-----------

SLML makes no claims about:

- ethical sufficiency
- legal compliance
- social desirability
- fairness outcomes
- policy alignment

SLML deliberately limits its scope to structural conditions in
order to avoid conflating admissibility with approval.


INTERPRETATION NOTICE
---------------------

This brief is provided solely for explanatory purposes.

In the event of conflict, ambiguity, or interpretive dispute,
the normative specification under:

  standard_released/Implementation/

controls exclusively.

No interpretation derived from this document supersedes or
modifies released normative artifacts.
